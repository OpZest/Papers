## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies bring both opportunities and concerns. To address the concerns, we need an inclusive AI landscape with a level playing field for all. Precision Shaking (PS) and Distillation-Oriented Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (DORPO) are concepts designed to train and run effective and efficient bespoke AI models privately.

PS is a method that extracts knowledge and skills from multiple AI models, specifically Large Language Models (LLM), just like shaking a tree to collect fruit. DORPO is a method to train a potentially smaller Language Model using the mentioned extracted knowledge and skills to create a model that is more efficient and can produce similar results to the LLM. To illustrate how these concepts work, we will use an analogy. Note that the analogy simplifies the concepts and may miss some nuances. It effectively illustrates the main ideas but might not capture every detail.

## Precision Shaking
Imagine a gardener tending to a garden. In the garden, there are a few large trees with many branches. Each branch has a unique function based on its position, and the potential to produce fruit.

The gardener's goal is to collect fruit at varying levels of ripeness for various tasks. For instance, less ripe oranges are perfect for zesting for use in recipes, riper ones for making fresh orange juice, while spoiled ones are only useful as compost. To achieve this, the gardener must develop techniques for shaking the trees that yield the desired output.

The large trees represent AI models, specifically Large Language Models (LLM). Their fruit represent the output generated by the model, and the gardener's techniques represent the prompt used to elicit specific outputs. By experimenting with different prompts and evaluating the results, the gardener can develop a methodology for producing desired outputs.

As fruit collection from different large trees continues, the gardener may identify patterns or techniques that consistently produce certain outputs. For example, if the task is to create orange juice and a specific shaking technique results in ripe oranges, that is considered a favored output; however, if less ripe or spoiled oranges falling are disfavored outputs. These findings can be used to create a training dataset, which can then be applied to other, but smaller trees (base models) with similar properties.

## DORPO
The gardener searches for a smaller tree with the potential to bear fruit of similar quality as the large trees. This smaller tree is more efficient because it requires less planting space and is easier to maintain. Using the findings from the dataset, the gardener applies the same shaking techniques to the smaller tree that have been used on the larger ones (prompt). 

By comparing the ripeness of the smaller tree's fruit with those that fell from the large trees while using the same shaking techniques, the gardener is able to determine if adjustments are necessary (loss function) to the smaller tree for it to provide the best output possible. If the smaller tree's fruit is less ripe than that of the large trees, the gardener makes the proper adjustments to the branches of the smaller tree to correct the output generated (backpropagation, parameter updates).

Through repeated cycles of adjustments, the gardener creates an effective small tree (SmaLLM). If anyone shakes this small tree in the proper manner, it should now produce output similar in quality to the large trees but with increased efficiency.

## Conclusion
PS and DORPO are concepts designed to empower users, often regardless of their background or expertise, to train and run effective and efficient bespoke models for specific use cases. By adopting PS and DORPO and utilizing them to build SmaLLMs, we can take a step closer toward building a more inclusive AI landscape that can benefit many people.
