# 🍊 Operation Zest 🍊

Welcome to the **Papers** repo! Here you'll find a collection of white papers, lite papers, status updates, open projects, and requests for contributions that drive our ecosystem forward.

## 🍊 The OpZest Ecosystem

The mission of OpZest is to enable individuals and communities to create, train, and utilize smaller language models (SmaLLMs), setting a shift in motion toward a more inclusive AI landscape where everyone can contribute and drive change. The OpZest ecosystem welcomes people, regardless of their technical knowledge, to participate in the creation of value and innovation through consumer-grade computers, forming communities, and collaboratively producing products. 

### Current Status

- **What we've achieved so far:**
  - **Communities Built**
    - Local: TBA
  - **MVP Development of SAPE**
    - Successfully implemented the SAPE concept ([see white paper](https://github.com/OpZest/Papers/blob/main/White_papers/Precision_Shaking_and_DORPO.md)) and developed an MVP version of SAPE with the fanstasy name *Steamline*, demonstrating initial functionality and potential

- **What's next:**
  - Securing funding for the next phase
  - Identify and select a high-impact use case, deploy multiple instances of *Steamline*, and create value
  - Launch an educational campaign to raise awareness about the importance of our initiative, and attract more participants

## 🌳 Open Projects

- Dynamic Simulations: [Link](https://github.com/OpZest/DynamicSimulations)
  - Experimental project using *Steamline*, featuring visually engaging, code-based simulations. We are looking for contributors to create more simulations - no technical knowledge is required to participate.
- Steamline:
  - Implementation of the SAPE concept. We are seeking software engineers to collaborate on further developing the MVP to fully realize its intended functions outlined in the white papers.

## 🌱 First Fruit Badge

- **What is a First Fruit Badge**: Exclusive token of appreciation for our earliest supporters who contribute to our project's success.
- **Blockchain Timestamp**: Each badge is timestamped on the Bitcoin blockchain using OpenTimestamps (OTS), ensuring its authenticity.
- **Verification**: You can verify the authenticity of your badge at any time by using the OTS file associated with it.

**Claim Your Badge:**
1. Go to [this link](https://opzest.com/#ffb).
2. Click the "Get my badge now" button.
3. Your badge will be timestamped, and a zip file containing the badge image (badge.png) and a stamp file (badge.png.ots) will be downloaded.
4. Make sure to store the downloaded zip file in a safe place, as this is the only copy you will have.
5. After a few hours, when the timestamp is confirmed by the Bitcoin blockchain, you can verify your badge by uploading both files from the zip [here](https://opzest.com/verify-badge).
