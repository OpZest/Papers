# 🍊 Operation Zest 🍊

Welcome to the **Papers** repo! Here you'll find a collection of white papers, lite papers, status updates, open projects, and requests for contributions that drive our ecosystem forward.

## 🍊 The OpZest Ecosystem

The mission of OpZest is to enable individuals and communities to create, train, and utilize smaller language models (SmaLLMs), setting a shift in motion toward a more inclusive AI landscape where everyone can contribute and drive change. The OpZest ecosystem welcomes people, regardless of their technical knowledge, to participate in the creation of value and innovation through consumer-grade computers, forming communities, and collaboratively producing products. 

### Current Status

- **What we've achieved so far:**
  - **Communities Built**
    - Local: TBA
  - **MVP Development of SAPE**
    - Successfully implemented the SAPE concept ([see white paper](https://github.com/OpZest/Papers/blob/main/White_papers/Precision_Shaking_and_DORPO.md)) and developed an MVP version of SAPE with the fanstasy name *Steamline*, demonstrating initial functionality and potential

- **What's next:**
  - Securing funding for the next phase
  - Identify and select a high-impact use case, deploy multiple instances of *Steamline*, and create value
  - Launch an educational campaign to raise awareness about the importance of our initiative, and attract more participants

## 🌳 Open Projects

- Dynamic Simulations: [Link](https://github.com/OpZest/DynamicSimulations)
  - Experimental project using *Steamline*, featuring visually engaging, code-based simulations. We are looking for contributors to create more simulations - no technical knowledge is required to participate.
- Steamline:
  - Implementation of the SAPE concept. We are seeking software engineers to collaborate on further developing the MVP to fully realize its intended functions outlined in the white papers.
